pbntc contest 29/10/2568

It's about iot and esp32.
there is some exam about how you program your esp32 to display your data on oled monitor".
and iot thing that you control the led light on esp32 from any program (etc. blink and other) but i've decide to make my own app.
so i make simple dashboard webapp that have dashboard page and control page for you can control led light over mqtt protocal,
you can deploy on any server you want, it run on nodejs, in my case i use raspberry 4.

first exam is about only esp32.
you have to read all sensor on kit such like dht ldr potentiometer and dislay on oled monitor.
and have some condition like if it dark enough led 1 has to bright and if it not led 1 have to off.

second exam is about iot.
you have to program your esp32 to connect wifi and conect to your app (in my case is my webapp) and you have to control
onkit led form your app.

(but i have prepare for this contest, i have writen dashboard for monitor sensor data but.....it's never have to use ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²)
